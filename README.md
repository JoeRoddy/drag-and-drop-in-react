# HTML5 Drag And Drop in React
This is a simple example of updating a component's state with html5 drag and drop events.

This is just javascript, it is NOT an implementation of [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd)

React-dnd can overcomplicate things when most use cases will just call for swapping two items in a list.

You can expand upon this example with additional drag events, demonstrated here:
